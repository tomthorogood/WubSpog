Wubspog is easy to use.

Install it to your Plugins directory on WordPress.
Set up the config file to have your HubSpot blog url, tabid, and moduleid (check your default RSS link for those).

Then insert shortcode [hubspot_blog tag="fun blog entries"] into your post. Et voila.

If you want to play with the style, edit style.php.
