WubSpog comes pre-packaged with MagPie RSS, available at http://magpierss.sourceforget.net.
This is used to parse the RSS feeds received from HubSpot.

To use WubSpog, place the WubSpog folder in your WordPress plugins directory. 
Edit the config file to reflect your blog's information: 

For instance, if your blog RSS feed is:

http://myHubSpotBlog.mySite.com/CMS/UI/Modules/BizBlogger/rss.aspx?tabid=12345&moduleID=67890, 
You'll change the config variables to be as follows:
$blog_domain = "myHubSpotBlog.mySite.com";
$tabid="12345";
$moduleid="67890";

After that, all you need to do is activate the plugin, and plop the shortcode into your WordPress pages!

[hubspot_blogs tag="coolstuff"] will pull in all posts from your feed tagged with "coolstuff".

You can leave spaces as they are in the tags; the plugin will make them URL-friendly:
[hubspot_blogs tag="my cool stuff"]

If you wish to play with styling, feel free to edit style.php.  

This is still very rough around the edges, but it does work!
