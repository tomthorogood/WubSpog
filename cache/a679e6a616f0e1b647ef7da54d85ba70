<p><b>Go Camping</b><br /> Take advantage of nice cool summer nights, and plan a camping trip to your local park or even your own backyard. Everybody knows that one of the greatest things about the summer is the weather. The great thing about doing a little camping in the backyard is that you&rsquo;re only a few steps from civilization, but you can still enjoy the beauty of the outdoors.</p>
<p><b>Go for a Hike</b><br /> Some parts of the country have brutal winters, so take advantage of this beautiful weather and check out some local trails in the area. Most places have beautiful trails for different fitness levels.</p>
<p><b>Keep an eye on daily deal websites</b><br /> Research daily deal websites to save tons of money on different activities around town. Things like hot air balloon rides, horseback riding, and kayak tours are some of the great things you can do on a dime.</p>
<p><b>Host a video game night<br /> </b>Break out the Wii, Xbox or Play station and invite some of your best gaming buddies over for an evening of gaming completion.</p>
<p><b>Neighborhood movie night</b><br /> Get the neighborhood together and set up a projector at the local park or in your backyard and play your favorite family movies. Inviting all the kids from the neighborhood to a movie night is a great way to keep it cheap, keep it cool and keep the kids entertained.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find Family deals at Hotels</li>
</ul>
The first thing to look for is a &ldquo;kids eat free&rdquo; family promotion when booking a hotel room. If that is not available, look for a hotel efficiency that includes a small kitchen. You can buy groceries at a local supermarket and eat the majority of meals at the hotel.
<ul>
<li>Look for special coupons on attractions.</li>
</ul>
Some places offer a discount when you purchase multiple tickets. Of course the best way to save is use the amenities that are available at your hotel versus going to different attractions. Ask the hotel staff for ideas about ways to entertain the family at a discount.
<ul>
<li>Continue to look for online deals.</li>
</ul>
Even after you book your hotel, go online periodically and see if any deals are being offered. Chances are, if you mention the deal to the hotel or resort when checking in they will honor the discount.
<ul>
<li>Avoid taxis and welcome public transportation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tourists usually take taxis since it&rsquo;s the laziest way to get from point A to B. Consider the subway or buses because it&rsquo;s typically much cheaper.</p>

If you follow these money-saving tips, you'll help stretch your grocery dollars, and still be able to come back with enough to stock your refrigerator and pantry.</p>
<p>1. Buy produce in season. Check the food section in your newspaper to find the best buys for the week, based on fresh produce in season. Food in season is usually priced to sell. During the summer months, corn on the cob can cost as little as 10 cents an ear; at other times of the year, it may cost 10 times as much. Also, shop your local farmers' market for great deals on local produce.</p>
<p>2. Use sales and coupons. Planning meals around what's on sale can lower your grocery bills, especially if you also use coupons (make sure they're for item you would buy anyway). Sunday newspapers are full of coupons and sales circulars to get you started. It's also a good idea to stock up on staples when they're on sale. "Buy one, get one free" is basically a technique to get you to buy twice as much as you need at half the price. At most markets, the product rings up half-price, so you don't have to buy more than one to get the savings. Use your freezer to store sale items that can be used at a later date.</p>
<p>3. Brown-bag it. Making lunch and taking it with you is a great money-saving tip and an excellent use of leftovers for meals at work, school, or wherever your destination. Packing your lunch not only saves you money, but you can control all the ingredients so they are healthy. Pack a simple sandwich, salad, soup, or wrap. Use freezer packs and containers to keep food at the proper temperature unless you have access to a refrigerator.</p>
<p>4. Think frozen, canned, or dried. Next time you're gathering ingredients for a recipe, try using frozen, canned, or dried foods. They are usually less expensive than fresh, yet are equally nutritious. Produce is typically frozen, canned, or dried at the peak of ripeness, when nutrients are plentiful. Use whatever form best fits your needs for the best price.</p>

<p>First, use your favorite search engine to run a quick search for the product. Many search engines now offer a shopping tab that can be clicked on to view a list of retailers that carry products and have chosen to advertize them with the specific search engine. For instance the popular search engine <em>Google</em> has 'Shopping'. This is the easiest way to comparison shop online.</p>
<p>Second, if you want to take it a step further than just doing a quick search, open a new browser and use their shopping section to compare the best price from each search engine's shipping function. I prefer to use <em>Google</em> shopping and then compare the results with <em>Yahoo</em> shopping.&nbsp; You may be surprised to find that the prices can be very different.</p>
<p>Third, look at online auction sites to see if there are any products that you&rsquo;re looking for listed. Vendors on these sites are often not held to MAP (Manufacturers Advertised Price), which is a strict pricing guideline enforced by the suppliers of online merchants. Many suppliers require that prices listed by online retailers follow this pricing guide, and can stop doing business with retailers that do not follow MAP. However online auctions are typically not held to the same rules because products are bid on, thus no price is advertized and retailers can sell them at a discount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, do another search with your favorite search engine using a combination of searches terms to look for discounts or coupon codes. I suggest using search terms like &ldquo;coupon code for ___&rdquo; ,&nbsp; &ldquo;5% off ___&rdquo;, &ldquo;10% off ____&rdquo;,&nbsp; &ldquo;best place to buy____&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lowest price____&rdquo;, or even try using the online retailers name and the search terms above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, search for forums related to the object you&rsquo;re considering purchasing. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking for a model airplane. Try searching using the search terms &ldquo;model airplane forums&rdquo;. Once you have found the name of a popular online forum, try searching for the name of the forum plus the product you&rsquo;re looking for. Often, you can find sponsors of the forum that give special deals to forum members or post coupon codes in the forums.</p>
<p>Finally, consider this money saving tip! Send an e-mail to the retailer to ask for the best price on an item. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to mention the deals you found elsewhere and ask if they can beat it. You may be pleasantly rewarded with a much lower price by simply sending a message!</p>";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Sara Hijaz";}s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 14:04:00 GMT";s:4:"guid";s:43:"f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:151271";s:7:"summary";s:3076:"<p><img id="img-1337279149792" src="http://blog.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/Portals/165952/images/Blog - Online shopping image.jpg" border="0" alt="Blog   Online shopping image" width="136" height="135" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;" />Many consumers know that purchasing items online can be a great way to save money and time.&nbsp; But consumers should be careful to use these quick money saving tips to ensure that they&rsquo;re getting the best deal for the money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, consider this money saving tip! Send an e-mail to the retailer to ask for the best price on an item. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to mention the deals you found elsewhere and ask if they can beat it. You may be pleasantly rewarded with a much lower price by simply sending a message!</p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1339509840;}i:6;a:10:{s:8:"comments";s:124:"http://blog.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/blog/bid/151289/Identify-Financial-Problems-then-Build-a-Budget#Comments";s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:5:"title";s:47:"Identify Financial Problems then Build a Budget";s:4:"link";s:115:"http://blog.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/blog/bid/151289/Identify-Financial-Problems-then-Build-a-Budget";s:11:"description";s:4023:"<p><img id="img-1337281279255" src="http://blog.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/Portals/165952/images/Building a budget image.jpg" border="0" alt="Building a budget image" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;" />Identifying the source of your financial problems is the first step to correcting them!&nbsp; While some causes are more evident than others, sometimes the financial stress is caused by a behavior rather than a more evident cause like divorce, loss of employment, medical issues, etc.&nbsp; The good news is that your behavior can be altered or controlled.&nbsp; If you shop because it releases stress, consider exercising instead.&nbsp; Or, if you like to buy big-ticket items just because you want to, challenge yourself by starting a savings account instead, and make yourself wait until you save up the funds. Also, if you overspend or buy items simply because you want to, then consider making a list and try to only buy what is needed.&nbsp; When you buy items on credit, you may not be considering how long it will take to pay that one item back!&nbsp; Even if it is on sale, it could take you twice as long to pay back if you only make minimum payments on your credit card, and by the time you do pay it back, you likely could have bought three of that one item!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some common causes of debt which may help you to identify the source of your financial hardship:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expenses outweigh Income:</span>&nbsp; If you have a reduction in pay, it could make it difficult to keep up with daily expenses, which can lead to falling into debt or borrowing money.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Divorce:</span>&nbsp; Generally, couples that are facing divorce usually have challenges with finances which can cause major stress for all parties.&nbsp; If you can come up with a plan together, that is usually more beneficial for everyone.&nbsp; If you cannot, then a lawyer, legal aid, or mediator may need to be called.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excessive Spending:</span>&nbsp; It is so easy to swipe a card and walk away, but spending beyond your means can result in debt!&nbsp; Sometimes it is difficult to pay back, and interest rates can increase when balances go up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unemployment:</span>&nbsp; To get through being unemployed, adjust your spending habits, prioritize expenses and seek help where available. Check with local resources such as Food Stamps, Utility help, Unemployment Compensation, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compulsive Gambling:</span>&nbsp; Some people become compulsive spenders which could become detrimental to their finances and well being. Before they know it, they are in serious debt and could face bankruptcy.&nbsp; The first step to recovery is to admit that there is a problem. Consider checking with Gamblers Anonymous if you or a loved one has difficulty with gambling addiction.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medical Expenses:</span>&nbsp; Without insurance, the cost of medical expenses can be extremely expensive.&nbsp; No one knows when an emergency may arise, so it is best to have medical insurance if you can afford it. If you cannot afford a private policy, ask your state if you qualify for their benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of potential financial problems, start improving it and build a budget!&nbsp; Start small by saving $5 a week or $20 a month.&nbsp; If you can save more, then do so. Also, try to earn additional income wherever possible. See if you can request a raise, work additional hours or overtime, or apply for a promotion. Also, encourage all family members to seek employment, even if only on a part-time basis.&nbsp;</p>

The lower interest rate will save you thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the mortgage. Many people, however, find themselves looking at the option of refinancing their home mortgage for a multitude of reasons; most often to achieve a lower mortgage rate.</p>
<p>It's important to know that refinancing involves costs, including broker fees, mortgage points, title insurance, appraisal fees, and potentially additional costs. These fees must be paid by cash, check, or the total amount will be added to the principal balance of the mortgage.</p>
<p>If you plan on staying in your home for a while, and paying the new mortgage long enough for the lower payment to make up for the added costs of refinancing, then that option may be the best one for you. However, be aware that your mortgage broker should tell you how long it will take to make up the costs. If the mortgage broker does not bring it up on his own, make sure to ask!</p>
<p>If your mortgage is five years old or more, refinancing to a new 30-year mortgage could result in higher interest payments, even if the rate is low. Instead, think about refinancing your home mortgage at a lower rate, but with the same final payment date as your existing mortgage. This will prevent you from paying thousands in interest. Also, refinancing to a larger mortgage and taking out cash reduces the equity in your home.</p>
<p>Being aware and understanding your options are the first step to deciding whether or not to refinance your home mortgage. If you have additional questions or need help understanding the process further, contact a ClearPoint Housing Counselor at 1.877.412.2227.</p>";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Sara Hijaz";}s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 13:13:00 GMT";s:4:"guid";s:43:"f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:160957";s:7:"summary";s:2074:"<p><img id="img-1338519895168" src="http://blog.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/Portals/165952/images/Refinancing mortgage image.jpg" border="0" alt="Refinancing mortgage image" width="222" height="147" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;" />Unless you are independently wealthy and can purchase a home with cash, then establishing a new mortgage with a significantly low interest rate is the next best thing!
